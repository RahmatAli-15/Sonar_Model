Sonar Rock vs. Mine Detection using Logistic Regression

**Overview**
This project aims to classify sonar signals as either Rock or Mine using a **Logistic Regression** model  
Each data point represents sonar signal readings bounced off a surface â€” the goal is to identify whether the object is a rock or a mine based on these frequency values.


**Objectives**
- Load and explore the **Sonar dataset**
- Perform **data preprocessing** and **feature scaling**
- Train a **Logistic Regression** model for classification
- Evaluate model performance on training and test data
